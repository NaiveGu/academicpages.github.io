I am a Ph.D. candidate in Operations Research at Georgia Tech ISYE. My current research interests lie in the fields of machine learning, non-convex optimization and discrete optimization. I am grateful to be advised by Professor [Santanu S. Dey](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~sdey30/index.html) and Professor [Shabbir Ahmed](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/people/faculty/Shabbir_Ahmed/).

Before coming to Georgia Tech, I graduated from Peking University with a B.S. degree in Applied Mathematics and a B.S. degree in Physics.

Please find my [CV](https://naivegu.github.io/master/files/CV.pdf) here.
