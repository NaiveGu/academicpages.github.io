I am a Quantitative Researcher at Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG). 

I earned my Ph.D. degree in Operations Research at Georgia Tech ISYE. I was grateful to be advised by Professor [Santanu S. Dey](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~sdey30/index.html) and Professor [Shabbir Ahmed](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/shabbir-ahmed).

Before studying at Georgia Tech, I graduated from Peking University with a B.S. degree in Applied Mathematics and a B.S. degree in Physics.
